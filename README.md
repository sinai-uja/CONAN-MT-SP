# CONAN-MT-SP

CONAN-SP is a a new dataset for Spanish counter-narrative. It include a hate-speech comment (HS) and the corresponded counter-narrative (CN). 

# How is constructed?

The English CONAN Multitarget (CONAN-MT) corpus ([Margherita Fanton et al. , 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.250.pdf) is taken as a starting point and an automatic translation is carried out using the API of DeepL to obtain the CONAN-MT-SP (CONAN Multitarget in Spanish) corpus.  CONAN-MT consists of 5003 HS-CN pairs covering multiple hate targets (DISABLED, JEWS, LGBT+, MIGRANTS, MUSLIMS, PEOPLE OF COLOR (POC), WOMEN)

GPT-4 model based on GPT technologies, is applied to the HS part of this corpus, which is provided as prompting together with 8 ContraNarrative (CN) examples.

Each instance of the corpus consists of the HS and CN part translated directly into Spanish with DeepL from the CONAN Multitarget corpus, plus the CN generated by GPT4. In addition, evaluations by human experts have also been included as part of the CONAN-MT-SP corpus. 

To construct CONAN-MT-SP, we remove the pairs that contain duplicates of hate-speech texts and the examples used in the prompt for the model to generate the counter-narrative. The prompt strategy used in GPT-4 model consist in a task description and 8 examples of HS-CN pairs (one for each target).

The structure of CONAN-MT-SP is the hate-speech and counternarrative provided by CONAN-MT and the counter-narrative texts generated by GPT-4 model. We do not apply any filter to the CN generated by GPT-4. Furthermore, we associated the values of the different metrics used in the manual evaluation carried by humans.

The evaluation metrics are:
- Offensiveness:  
	- 0 (not sure)  
	- 1 (not offensive)  
	- 2 (maybe offensive)  
	- 3 (completely offensive)  
- Stance:  
	- 0 (irrelevant)  
	- 1 (strongly agree)  
	- 2 (slightly agree/disagree)  
	- 3 (strongly disagree)  
- Informativeness: 
	- 0 (irrelevant)  
	- 1 (not informative)  
	- 2 (generic and uninformative statement)  
	- 3 (specific and informative)  
- Truthfulness:  
	- 0 (not sure)  
	- 1 (not true)  
	- 2 (partially true)  
	- 3 (completely true)
- Editing required: 
	- 0 (no editing)  
	- 1 (yes editing)  
- Comparison between H-M:  
	- 0 (both CN are equally valid)  
	- 1 (human generates a better CN)  
	- 2 (machine generates a better CN)  
	- 3 (neither CN is good)

    abstract = "This paper describes the automated generation of CounterNarratives (CNs) for Hate Speech (HS) in Spanish using GPT-based models. Our primary objective is to evaluate the performance of these models in comparison to human capabilities. For this purpose, the English CONAN Multitarget corpus is taken as a starting point and we use the DeepL API to automatically translate into Spanish. Two GPT-based models, GPT-3 and GPT-4, are applied to the HS segment through a few-shot prompting strategy to generate a new CN. As a consequence of our research, we have created a high quality corpus in Spanish that includes the original HS-CN pairs translated into Spanish, in addition to the CNs generated automatically with the GPT models and that have been evaluated manually. The resulting CONAN-MT-SP corpus and its evaluation will be made available to the research community, representing the most extensive linguistic resource of CNs in Spanish to date. The results demonstrate that, although the effectiveness of GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3, both models can be used as systems to automatically generate CNs to combat the HS. Moreover, these models consistently outperform human performance in most instances.",
